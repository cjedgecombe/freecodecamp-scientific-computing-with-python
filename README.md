# Scientific Computing with Python
 
Contained herein are my solutions to the five final projects of freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python Course. I did all my development for those projects in replit, as is required for the course, but I wanted the record of that development to live on GitHub as well. It should go without saying, but if you are taking the Scientific Computing with Python course and you stumbled across this code, turn back! It's always better in the long run to figure these solutions out for yourself.
